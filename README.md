## Project Summary

<!-- 🎒 Add a project summary here in 250 words or less. -->
In today's day and age, the one thing that brings people together is movies. Motion pictures provide us with the opportunity to escape our real-world problems regardless of our age, race, religion, or location. We were inspired by the ability of movies to connect and bring joy to people and have implemented a dashboard that let's you explore more about the films you love to watch. 
Our dashboard is expansive and interactive but at the same time it is user adaptable. The dashboard let's you explore movies and the user has the capability to filter them by rating and revenue across different genres. The dashboard is not limited to information about English movies, the user can learn more about movies released in foreign languages and their place of origin.
Hence our interface is a one-stop hub for all cinephiles, where they can learn and explore more information about their favourite movies, the movie industry and how it has transitioned over time. 

## Contributions

<!-- 🎒 Complete for each project member. -->
- Rushi: Vue.js framework implmentation and integration of all charts. Created the d3 layout map.
- Divya: Preprocessing and cleaning of Data. Found appropriate geojson mapbox data. D3 symbol map, interactive bar charts and timeline map were created and implemented.
- Aparna: Handled colour scheme and UI of the app . Made the animated bar chart.

All the other charts were equally divided amongst all of us and we created them individually. We later merged and integrated them into our Vue App. Documentation was also divided amongst the three.


## Proposal presentation

- Divya designed the presentation and created the intro slides 
- Aparna was responsible for researching for interesting visuals for the proposal presentation and oversaw tbe literature review.
- Rushi was responsible for searching for appropriate frameworks and creating time line.

## Final presentation

- Rushi created/presented the slides about the idea,motivation and introduction of the project.
- Aparna created/presented the slides about previous work done, the data and originality of the project.
- Divya created/presented the slides regarding design methodology, D3 charts and future scope of the project.

## Paper


- Divya wrote the Introduction and Data Section as she was most familiar with data used. SHe also highlighted the main features in the app.
- Aparna was responsible for writing the Related Work section and general formatting of the paper.
- Rushi handled the System and Design Approaches in the paper.

## Demo

[Tommy Trojan](mailto:tommy@usc.edu)

- Divya was responsible for D3 layout and Mapbox map as well aggregating the data for smooth implementation of all charts.
- Aparna handled the  Animated chart and researched for background colors, and images which could make our website interesting. She handled the UI.
- Rushi implemented the framework and dealt with Interactive Pie and Proportional Symbol map chart.

The three of us split the creation of charts amongst ourselves and constantly tested it on our Web app to make sure its running as expected.

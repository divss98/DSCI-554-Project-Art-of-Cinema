## Project Summary

<!-- 🎒 Add a project summary here in 250 words or less. -->
In today's day and age, the one thing that brings people together is movies. Motion pictures provide us with the opportunity to escape our real-world problems regardless of our age, race, religion, or location. We were inspired by the ability of movies to connect and bring joy to people and have implemented a dashboard that let's you explore more about the films you love to watch. 
Our dashboard is expansive and interactive but at the same time it is user adaptable. The dashboard let's you explore movies and the user has the capability to filter them by rating and revenue across different genres. The dashboard is not limited to information about English movies, the user can learn more about movies released in foreign languages and their place of origin.
Hence our interface is a one-stop hub for all cinephiles, where they can learn and explore more information about their favourite movies, the movie industry and how it has transitioned over time. 

## Contributions

<!-- 🎒 Complete for each project member. -->
- Framework implementation and how vue can be integrated with different charts was done by Rushi.
- Divya found and preprocessed the data from raw data available on the internet to cleaned csv formatted data that can be used for our graphs. In addition to this, she also made searched for appropriate mapbox geojson data.
- Last but not least, Aparna oversaw the visually appealing implementation of all the charts and how we can provide most information through our website.

## Proposal presentation

[Tommy Trojan](mailto:tommy@usc.edu)

- Divya created the slides regarding data preprocessing and the framework and systems used in the demo.
- Aparna created the slides which were showing the different aspects of the web application and various charts
- Rushi created the slides about the motivation of the project and the intro slides.

## Paper

[Tommy Trojan](mailto:tommy@usc.edu)

- Divya wrote the Introduction and Data Section as she was most familiar with data used.
- Aparna was responsible for writing Abstract and conclusion as well as Related Work section
- Rushi handled the System and Design Approaches in the paper.

## Demo

[Tommy Trojan](mailto:tommy@usc.edu)

- Divya was responsible for D3 layout and Mapbox map as well as making charts simple and full of information for naive users.
- Aparna handled Responsive and interactive charts and researched for background colors, and images which could make our website interesting.
- Rushi implmented the framework and dealt with Animated Chart and Proportional Symbol map chart

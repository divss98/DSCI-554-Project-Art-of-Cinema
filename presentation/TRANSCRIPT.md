## Slide 1
Good Afternoon, today we will be giving a brief overview of our project and it's different applications.
## Slide 2
In this project we wanted to build an interface that let's user explore the movie industry and learn about the different films released. Our system retains simplicity while being user interactive. The user has the capabilty to explore various details information through different graphics.
## Slide 3
We divided the work equally amongst the three of us. - Rushi worked on the Vue.js framework implmentation and integration of all charts. He also created the d3 layout map. Divya worked on preprocessing and cleaning the Data. She handled the interactive charts and symbol map. Aparna handled the colour scheme and UI of the app. She created the animated bar chart. All the other charts were equally divided amongst all of us and we created them individually. We later merged and integrated them into our Vue App. Documentation was also divided amongst the three.
## Slide 4
We wanted our dashboard to be comprehensive such that the user has the capability to explore and navigate between various information. Hence we used different datasets for visualizing different charts and made sure all the charts we present contains non-redundant information. We used IMDB movies, Top 1000 movies, and Oscar Winners movie dataset , acquired from Kaggle. 
## Slide 5
We looked for visualizations and infographics available online for inspiration. We analyzed the visualizations available online to gain insights on which graphs will be the most suitable to convey a certain kind of information.
## Slide 6
We found that most datasets focused on comparing and analysing the movies in terms of profitability. We wanted to make sure our dashboard provided users with the functionality to explore and learn different information. The user has the capability to navigate between genres and it is made to be interactive.
